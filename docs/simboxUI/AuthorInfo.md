# AuthorInfo Component

The `AuthorInfo` component is a reusable React component that displays information about an author, including their name, avatar, and optionally, a date. It is designed to be used in contexts where author information needs to be displayed, such as blog posts, articles, or user profiles.

## Props

The `AuthorInfo` component accepts the following props:

| Prop Name   | Type                 | Default | Description                                                                         |
|-------------|----------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `author`    | `Object`             | -       | An object containing the author's name and avatar URL.                              |
| `date`      | `string`             | -       | (Optional) A date string representing the date associated with the author.          |
| `className` | `string`             | `''`    | (Optional) Additional CSS class name(s) to be applied to the component's container. |
| `style`     | `React.CSSProperties` | -       | (Optional) Custom inline styles to be applied to the component's container.         |

The `author` prop is an object that should have the following properties:
- `name` (string): The name of the author.
- `avatar` (string): The URL of the author's avatar image.

## Usage

To use the `AuthorInfo` component in your React application, follow these steps:

1. Import the `AuthorInfo` component into your file:

```jsx
import AuthorInfo from './AuthorInfo';
```

2. Render the `AuthorInfo` component with the required `author` prop and optional `date`, `className`, and `style` props:

```jsx
<AuthorInfo
  author={{
    name: 'John Doe',
    avatar: 'https://example.com/avatar.jpg',
  }}
  date="2023-06-10"
  className="mb-4"
/>
```

3. Customize the appearance of the component by providing different values for the `className` and `style` props, if needed.

## Styling

The `AuthorInfo` component uses utility classes from a CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS) to style the component. The component renders a container with a flex layout, aligning the avatar and author information horizontally.

The avatar is rendered using the `Avatar` component, which should be imported separately. The size of the avatar is set to "small".

The author's name is displayed in a semibold font with a dark gray color (or light gray in dark mode). If a `date` prop is provided, it is formatted using the `date-fns` library and displayed below the author's name in a smaller font size with a lighter gray color.

You can apply custom CSS classes or inline styles to the component's container using the `className` and `style` props, respectively.

## Dependencies

The `AuthorInfo` component has the following dependencies:

- `react`: The React library itself.
- `./Avatar`: The `Avatar` component, which should be defined in a separate file.
- `date-fns`: A library for formatting and manipulating dates in JavaScript.

Make sure to install these dependencies and import them correctly in your project.
