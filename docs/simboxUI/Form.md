# Form Component

The `Form` component is a reusable React component that creates a form with customizable content, submission handling, and styling options.

## Props

The `Form` component accepts the following props:

| Prop Name   | Type                                                 | Default | Description                                                    |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `onSubmit`  | `(event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => void` | -       | A callback function to handle the form submission event.       |
| `children`  | `React.ReactNode`                                    | -       | The content to be rendered inside the form.                    |
| `className` | `string`                                             | `''`    | Additional CSS class name(s) to be applied to the form.        |
| `style`     | `React.CSSProperties`                                | -       | Custom inline styles to be applied to the form.                |
| `id`        | `string`                                             | -       | The ID attribute to be applied to the form.                    |

## Usage

To use the `Form` component in your React application, follow these steps:

1. Import the `Form` component into your file:

```jsx
import Form from './Form';
```

2. Render the `Form` component with the desired props and child elements:

```jsx
<Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="my-form" id="myForm">
  {/* Form fields and other content */}
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</Form>
```

3. Implement the `onSubmit` callback function to handle the form submission event:

```jsx
const handleSubmit = (event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
  // Handle form submission logic
  console.log('Form submitted');
};
```

## Styling

The `Form` component applies a default `space-y-6` class to add vertical spacing between form elements. You can provide additional CSS classes using the `className` prop to customize the appearance of the form.

Additionally, you can apply custom inline styles to the form using the `style` prop.

## Form Submission

The `Form` component handles the form submission event by preventing the default form submission behavior and invoking the `onSubmit` callback function provided as a prop. The `onSubmit` function receives the form submission event as a parameter, allowing you to access form data and perform any necessary actions.

Make sure to implement the `onSubmit` callback function to handle the form submission logic according to your application's requirements.

## Accessibility

To improve the accessibility of the form, you can provide a unique `id` prop to the `Form` component. This ID can be used to associate labels with form fields using the `htmlFor` attribute, enhancing the usability of the form for assistive technologies.
