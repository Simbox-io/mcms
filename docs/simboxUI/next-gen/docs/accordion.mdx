# Accordion

The Accordion component is a collapsible content container that allows users to toggle the visibility of multiple sections independently or exclusively.

## Usage

```tsx
import Accordion from './Accordion';

const accordionItems = [
  {
    title: 'Section 1',
    content: 'Content for section 1',
  },
  {
    title: 'Section 2',
    content: 'Content for section 2',
  },
  // Add more accordion items as needed
];

<Accordion items={accordionItems} />
```

## AccordionItem Interface

The `AccordionItem` interface defines the structure of each accordion item:

```tsx
interface AccordionItem {
  title: string;
  content: React.ReactNode;
}
```

- `title`: The title or heading of the accordion section.
- `content`: The content to be displayed when the accordion section is expanded. It can be any valid React node (e.g., text, elements, components).

## Behavior

- Clicking on an accordion header toggles the visibility of its corresponding content section.
- By default, only one accordion section can be expanded at a time. Clicking on another header will collapse the previously expanded section.
- If the `allowMultiple` prop is set to `true`, multiple accordion sections can be expanded simultaneously.

## Customization

The Accordion component provides several props for customization:

- `className`: Allows adding custom CSS classes to the accordion container for styling purposes.
- `headerClassName`: Allows adding custom CSS classes to the accordion header buttons for styling purposes.
- `contentClassName`: Allows adding custom CSS classes to the accordion content sections for styling purposes.

## Accessibility

The Accordion component follows accessibility guidelines:

- The accordion headers are rendered as `<button>` elements with appropriate ARIA attributes (`aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`) to indicate their state and associated content.
- The accordion content sections have unique `id` attributes that match the `aria-controls` attribute of their corresponding headers.

## Animation

The Accordion component uses the `Transition` component from the `@headlessui/react` library to animate the expanding and collapsing of accordion sections. The animation is controlled by the `show` prop and customized using CSS classes for enter and leave transitions.
