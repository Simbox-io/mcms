## Features

- Displays a search input field with a search button.
- Supports dark mode styling using Tailwind's dark mode classes.
- Includes a clear button (X icon) that appears when there is text in the input field. Clicking the clear button clears the input and focuses back on the input field.
- Allows clearing the input field automatically after performing a search when the `clearOnSearch` prop is set to `true`.
- Focuses the input field automatically when the component mounts if the `autoFocus` prop is set to `true`.

## Styling

The SearchBar component is styled using Tailwind utility classes. It adapts to dark mode based on the dark mode setting of the application. The input field and buttons adjust their colors accordingly.

The component is fully responsive and can be customized by providing additional CSS classes through the `className` prop.

## Dependencies

The SearchBar component uses the following dependencies:

- `@heroicons/react/24/outline`: Provides the `MagnifyingGlassIcon` and `XMarkIcon` icons for the search and clear functionalities.

Make sure to install the required dependencies before using the SearchBar component.
