## Functionality

- Clicking the "Choose File" button triggers the file input click event.
- When files are selected, the `onFileChange` callback is invoked with the selected files.
- The selected files are displayed below the button with their names.
- Each selected file has a remove button to remove it from the list.
- The component uses Framer Motion for animations on the button and selected files.

## Styling

The FileUpload component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling. The main styles include:

- The "Choose File" button has a blue background color and white text.
- The button scales up on hover and scales down on tap using Framer Motion.
- The selected files are displayed in a gray background with rounded corners.
- The remove button for each file has a hover effect to change its color to red.
- The component container can be customized with additional CSS classes using the `className` prop.

## Dependencies

The FileUpload component has the following dependencies:

- React
- Framer Motion
- Heroicons (for the remove icon)

Make sure to install these dependencies before using the component.

## Accessibility

The FileUpload component follows accessibility best practices:

- The file input is hidden visually but accessible to screen readers.
- The "Choose File" button has a clear text label.
- The remove buttons for selected files have appropriate ARIA attributes.
