## Features

- Supports dark mode using Tailwind's dark mode classes.
- Animated underline effect when the textarea is focused.
- Character count display when the `maxLength` prop is provided.
- Auto-resize functionality to adjust the textarea height based on its content.
- Fade-in animation when the component mounts.

## Styling

The Textarea component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling. It applies a default set of classes for the textarea element, which can be overridden or extended using the `className` prop.

The component also supports dark mode by utilizing Tailwind's dark mode classes. When the dark mode is enabled, the textarea and its associated elements will adapt their colors accordingly.

## Animations

The Textarea component includes two animations powered by Framer Motion:

1. Fade-in animation: When the component mounts, it applies a fade-in animation to smoothly introduce the textarea.
2. Underline animation: When the textarea is focused, an animated underline appears below the textarea to provide visual feedback to the user.

These animations enhance the user experience and add a touch of interactivity to the component.
